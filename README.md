# Crimes-Rate-After-COVID
Hong Kong carried a dual reputation as a global financial hub on the surface, but a city shaped by decades of organised crime, triads, and high-profile criminal cases. Popular culture constantly amplified this image with films, such as Infernal Affairs (無間道) and Young and Dangerous (古惑仔), that portrayed Hong Kong as a turbulent battleground between law enforcement and criminal syndicates.
Recently, the Chief of the Hong Kong Police Force claimed that the city has become “safer and more peaceful” due to decreasing crime levels. However, crime statistics from pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID periods reveal sharper fluctuations in both violent and non-violent crime categories, especially fraud and theft.  We aim to challenge the public statements of the current Chief of Police about the improved safety and the actual crime trends in Hong Kong, particularly the dramatic post-COVID surge in fraud-related offenses. This discrepancy raises concerns about whether crime is decreasing, transforming, or being reframed, and what the main reason of crimes is.
Although it is claimed that Hong Kong is far safer today, the contrast between this cinematic past and modern crime trends raises the question. 
To evaluate the validity of the claim, this study examines long-term crime trends using 15.1 tables from Hong Kong Annual Digest of Statistics 2024 as it clearly shows how number of crimes has been changed between 2013 and 2024.
